    <h1>Promises in JavaScript</h1>

    <B>A promise is an object that represents an operation which has produced or will eventually produce a value.</B>
    <br>
    <h3>Syntax</h3>
    <div>
        var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
        <br>
            //do something
        <br>
       });
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
       <h3> A Promise is in one of these states:</h3>
        <B>Pending</B> — The initial state where the outcome is not known as the operation is not completed yet.
        <br>
        <B>Fulfilled</B> — The state of a promise representing a successful operation with the resulting value.
        <br>
        <B>Rejected</B> — The state of a promise representing a failed operation with a reason why it failed.
        <br>
        Once a promise is fulfilled or rejected, it is immutable (i.e. it can never change again).
    </div>
    <BR>
    <div>
        The <B>Promise.all()</B> static method accepts an iterable (e.g. an Array) of promises and returns a new promise, which resolves when all promises in the iterable have resolved, or rejects if at least one of the promises in the iterable have rejected.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>The <B>Promise.race()</B> static method accepts an iterable of Promises and returns a new Promise which resolves or rejects as soon as the first of the promises in the iterable has resolved or rejected.</div>
    <script src="main.js"></script>

    <br>
    <div>
        The <B>Promise.resolve()</B> method returns a Promise object that is resolved with a given value. If the value is a promise, that promise is returned; if the value is a thenable, the returned promise will "follow" that thenable, adopting its eventual state; otherwise the returned promise will be fulfilled with the value. 
    </div>

    <br>
    <div>
        The <B>Promise.reject()</B> method returns a Promise object that is rejected with a given reason.
    </div>
